Technologies used:
--------------------

This project is created with: 
* Vanilla JavaScript
* HTML5
* CSS

Approach: 
----------

To start this project, I created a list of things that I wanted on the website. Using that list, I ranked it from most important to least, while also weighting each item on time required. 
Having this plan to begin, I made a basic board and created the basic game logic, and hard-coded the minimum amount that would preform as expected. From there, I built each block of functionality on top of a solid base, and when it was working as expected, I moved onto the next. 
During the course of creating this app, each functionality increased the level of flexibility every other function needed, so it forced me to gradually refactor my code as I went to maintain the same functionality. 

Lessons Learned: 
-----------------

My main takeaway from this project has been to keep code as simple as possible to provide exactly the utility necessary, and *only increase complexity if strictly required.*

Setup:
---------

To run this project, you can download the source code, or see it live at https://sarahleah.github.io/ticTacToe/ 

Unsolved Problems:
-------------------

- Currently there is no way to save player data
- When an outcome occurs, the # that hold the space in the buttons all become visible. This is difficult to fix because the translucent appearance of the buttons indicates their utility well, but because of the color changing background, it is difficult to find a solution that makes the text invisible.
- I would like to have a more succinct solution to the win/lose problem. 

Future Additions: 
-------------------

I would like to add: 
- Sign in to use local storage to save game scores
- Improve UX of popup settings at start
